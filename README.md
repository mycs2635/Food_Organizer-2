#Food organizer 

The hunger Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending hunger in the world by 2030.

India is one of the worst performers on the global hunger index,ranking 94 out of 104 countries in 2020.

The existing methods mostly concentrate on how to manage the food waste rather than preventing the food waste.

We are making an app which helps the households to keep tracking of their supermarket purchases and expiry dates which avoids excess buying and wastage and gives a notification a day before the expiry date of a product in the inventory.

The users are able to Donate and Collect food with the help of location.

Our app outline :

    The profile page shows some details of the user and some statistics like Food saved ,Points gained ,No of products in the inventory etc.
   
  Inventory Fragment

    The inventory page showcases all the products added by the user and allows him/hwe to remind him when to use.
    
  Donation page
    One can share their left over food through this app.
    He needs to add a picture of the food and the location
    The Donation page helps in donating the food and the needy to collect the food.
    
    We used Realtime database and authentication of firebase to manage data.

 They can have an inventory page in which they will have the products they have and their expiry dates
 
 In the home page they can add the elements that they buy now so that they can have an idea of the expiry date so that they will consume them without wasting

 If the user wants to recieve there is a collect page where we will have the items that are available and their corresponding addresses so that one can reach out to them
 
 
 ------- goal  --
    
Our project is to work on one of the SDG Goals and we thought Zero Hunger goal is the right one because it's one of the major problem that our country is facing now.

We got to know that Each day more than 10,000  children die from hunger and related causes.

And the other side 1/3 rd of the food produced in the world  for human consumption every year - 1.3 billion tonnes approximately is getting wasted.

In this the household food waste estimate is 50kg per capita per year or 686,760,163 tonnes a year and about 10 to 20% of the food at weddings and functions in India goes waste and annual food waste is nearly US $ 14 billion .

So we thought of saving food from the household perspective by helping them managing the raw materials and cooking products which are being wasted in many houses bcz of getting spoiled or expired.

Our app helps them to add the products to the inventory and set an notification before the date of expiry.

Our app also helps in donating the food to needy.

We first designed layouts of the app and started learning app devolopment parallally.
